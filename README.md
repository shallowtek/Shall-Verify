## Architecture Overview

Shall Verify is architected as a **.NET-based microservices solution**, leveraging strong domain boundaries and shared infrastructure for maximum flexibility and maintainability.  
Key architectural highlights include:

- **Microservices**: Independently deployable services (e.g., Configuration, Lookup, Orchestration, Records, Verification)
- **Shared Libraries**: Common contracts, models, and service defaults for DRY, robust code
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, orchestration, and services are fully decoupled
- **Cloud/Container Ready**: Solution is ready for containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD
- **.NET Aspire**: AppHost for unified local orchestration

## Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

- **.NET 8 & C#**: Leveraging latest language features and SDKs
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven, highly testable, SOLID principles
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in .NET DI for all services
- **Async/Await & Task-Based Programming**: Non-blocking, high-performance
- **Strong Typing & Contracts**: DTOs, config, and validation shared via common library
- **API-First Design**: Minimal APIs or Controllers with clear OpenAPI/Swagger integration
- **Configuration Management**: `appsettings.json` hierarchy, per-environment config
- **Service Discovery & Communication**: Pattern-ready for REST/gRPC messaging
- **Test Automation**: xUnit/NUnit, mocking, and coverage reporting
- **Containerization Ready**: Clean separation for Docker/Kubernetes deployment
- **DevOps Friendly**: Source control, `.gitignore`, and solution-level build scripts

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- (Optional) Docker for containerization

### Build and Run All Services

```bash
cd src
dotnet build Shall.Verify.sln
dotnet run --project AspireApp1
```

> **Tip:** Each service can also be run and debugged individually via Visual Studio or VS Code.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd src/Shall.Verify.Tests
dotnet test
```

---

## Development Practices

- **Version Control**: Clean `.gitignore`, repo ready for CI/CD pipelines
- **Extensibility**: New services can be added in minutes—just update the solution and DI registration
- **Code Quality**: Strict code style, nullability checks, and analyzer integration
- **Secrets Handling**: Ready for [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets), environment variables, or vaults
- **Configurable Logging**: Plug-and-play logging for diagnostics and observability

---

## Testing

- **xUnit/NUnit** for robust, isolated unit and integration tests
- **Mocking** for interfaces and service dependencies
- **Testable Architecture**: All business logic separated from infrastructure and endpoints

---

## Extensibility

Shall Verify is designed for change. Want to add a new verification workflow, swap out a data store, or scale services independently?  
This solution’s **plug-in** architecture makes those changes safe and fast.
